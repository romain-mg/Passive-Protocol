# Passive Protocol

**Passive Protocol is an on-chain index fund protocol**

Passive allows users to get exposure to multiple tokens (currently 2) by buying a single token.

Developers can re-use the protocol to deploy new funds with exposure to new cryptocurrencies.

## Structure

The core contract of the protocol is the IndexFund contract. The fund shares are represented by the PSVToken ERC-20 token.

As of January 2025, the protocol is still in development.
